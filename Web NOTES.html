  <p>It is a collection of <b>HTML</b> documents , which are written in HTML language.All the documents in HTML are glued with a links, which is called "Hyperlinks".HTML is the foundation of webPage.We can also display images, videos,text on the web.Major pieces of web are the following:
    <li>Browser on our computer</li>

    <li>Servers</li>
  <p>Web Piece Detail: We send request through HTML text document written in
   <span style="color:blue">HTML language</span> , which will be carried by 'http' protocol & send it to the server,here the server is a collection of files sitting at one place.Server will interpret the request and send the response to the broser.HTML document consists of the following:
    <li>Text Document</li>
    <li>Markup
      <p> It consists of different tags.Such as em,a, etc.Tags starts with the opening tag and closing tag whereas some of the tag do not have closing tag is called <span style="color:blue"> Void Tag</span>.The content with opening  and closing tag  is called  <span style="color:blue".>element</span>

    <h2> White Spaces</h1>
       <p> When we write text in multiple lines and reder it in HTML, the text render in a  single line because HTML brings all the newline as a single line.
    <h2>Inline vs Block</h2>
    <p>We use 'br' tag   is an inline tag  break lines,wheras p tag displays an 'invisible box' around the text we display, which does have height and width.'Div','P' tag are block.
      
    <h2>Computers are Stupid</h2>
    <p> Computers are stupid , it does not mean we are abusing the computer.Actually it means that computer has its own language to understand the instruction given by the programmer.It does not accept  the simple text.
